This is an extension to the uEmacs/PR 4.0.
That was obtained by:
 git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/editors/uemacs/uemacs.git uemacs
in early Feb 2017.
I wasn't working in git at the time, so didn't fork it. In the end I put
all of that code into my own local git and started from there. So the
original 4.015 branch is just that. Then I uploaded it to github, but
didn't want to go back to a fork and have to start again.

The main extension as to add code which had been put into 3.9e many
years ago to make the bottom line into a minibuffer - you can use many
uemacs commands to move around, delete, yank etc.  It handles
filename expansion (ctlI/tab), albeit in a different manner to 4.015.
That code also handles environment variable expansion.

Other changes so far made are:
  o make some things user-configurable in start-up files such as
    * the definition of "end of sentence" characters,
    * how twiddle and forward word work (ggr-mode)
  o fix the display of "binary files" (where ^X and \yy are used),
  o handle utf8 character strings in the message/minibuffer line and the
    modeline.
  o better handlingf utf8 strings (zero-width character handling).
  o Add all options to the usage() output, and handle command-line
    options better.
  o enable ctl-Q and ctl-S as command (rather than XON/XOFF).
  o allow user-created procedures to be bound directly to keys (without
    needing to use one of the 40 numbered macros), and make the
    key-table dynamicllay asibsgend, so that it is no longer a limited
    size.
  o allows you to define key-sequences (phonetic translation tables)
    that get mapped, on input, to other strings.
    Useful for utf8 input form an ASCII keyboard.

Other changes to be made are:
  o better handle utf8 strings (ongoing...),
  o make some buffer dynamically allocatable to cater for very long
    pieces of text and enlarge others,
    modeline.

NOTE:
The uemacs.rc file re-binds various keys from the standard settings in
the source files. The uemacs.hlp file reflects these re-bindings (since
if the code finds the hlp file, it should have found the rc file).

For LICENCE details see the README file in the archive directory.
