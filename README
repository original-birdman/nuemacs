This is an extension to the uEmacs/pK 4.0.
That was obtained by:
 git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/editors/uemacs/uemacs.git uemacs
in early Feb 2017.
I wasn't working in git at the time, so didn't fork it. In the end I put
all of that code into my own local git and started from there. So the
original 4.015 branch is just that. Then I uploaded it to github, but
didn't want to go back to a fork and have to start again.

The main extension as to add code which had been put into 3.9e many
years ago to make the bottom line (modeline) into a minibuffer - you can
use many uemacs commands to move around, delete, yank etc. You can set
modes (including Phon mode) in it.
It handles filename expansion (ctlI/tab), albeit in a different manner
to 4.015.  That code also handles environment variable expansion.

It also now has improved utf8 character class/property support, which
has been done by making use of the Julia Lang utf8proc library.  As a
result this uemacs is now DEPENDENT ON that library!
See the PREREQUISITE file.

Other changes so far made are:
  o make some things user-configurable in start-up files such as
    * the definition of "end of sentence" characters,
    * how twiddle and forward word work (ggr-mode)
  o fix the display of "binary files" (where ^X and \yy are used),
  o handle utf8 character strings in the message/minibuffer line and the
    modeline.
  o better handling of utf8 strings (zero-width character handling).
  o Add all options to the usage() output, and handle command-line
    options better.
  o enable ctl-Q and ctl-S as command (rather than XON/XOFF).
  o allow user-created procedures to be bound directly to keys (without
    needing to use one of the 40 numbered macros), and make the
    key-table dynamically assigned, so that it is no longer a limited
    size.
  o Added horizontal scrolling (from 3.10e).
  o Changed file encryption so it now encrypts all bytes, not just
    ASCII ones.
  o Input and output now buffered into an 8kB block, significantly
    speeding up file processing,
  o keyboard macros are also collected as commands in a buffer rather
    than just as keystrokes.
  o run any file-hooks (and file-hooks-<<sfx>>) user macros when a file
    is read in
  o added a "Phon" mode, to allow input of non-ASCII characters with an
    ASCII keyboard using a lookup table mapping.
    Czech and Russian tables are provided.
  o Added a set of ring buffers for each of search and replace string.
    You can move back and forward through the last 10 by using
    previous-window/next-window when searching.
    You can insert the currently-selected default into the search buffer
    with list-buffers. (These functions were otherwise disabled in the
    minibuffer).
  o Added a set of kill-buffers for the last deletes.
    If you yank (^Y) you can then do yank_prev_killbuf (Esc-Y) to change
    that yanked text with the previous deletes in turn. Only works if
    you do nothing else after the yank.
    Also works after yank-minibuffer.
    Note that yanking rotates the kill-ring list.

Other changes to be made are:
  o better handle utf8 strings (ongoing...),
  o make some buffers dynamically allocatable to cater for very long
    pieces of text and enlarge others,

NOTE:
The uemacs.rc file re-binds various keys from the standard settings in
the source files. The uemacs.hlp file reflects these re-bindings (since
if the code finds the hlp file, it should have found the rc file).
