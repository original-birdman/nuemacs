fillpara() and justpara() don't know about zero-width characters.
These routines also need to be combined into one, with a variety of
front-ends.

forwword() and backword() don't know about anything other than ASCII
work characters. Should(?) handle unicode ones.
Similar failing applies to the upperword(), lowerword() and capword()
functions.

Might not be a bug - just needs a think...
Word-wrapping doesn't happen on yank(), even if there is a space in the
yank()ed text.
But then there is also the question of what happens to newlines in
the restored text.
Also, when wrapping, should we just wrap the last word, or wrap the line
at first-before fillcol?
Perhaps do wrapping if wrap-mode was on at *both* the kill and yank
stages (so need to have a way of tagging the kill buffers).

Horizontal scrolling (which was in 3.9e).
Did anyone ever use it?
