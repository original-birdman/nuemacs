RETHINK??? RETHINK??? RETHINK??? RETHINK??? RETHINK??? RETHINK???
Might not be a bug - just needs a think...
Word-wrapping doesn't happen on yank(), even if there is a space in the
yank()ed text.
But then there is also the question of what happens to newlines in
the restored text.
Perhaps do wrapping if wrap-mode was on at *both* the kill and yank
stages (so would need to have a way of tagging the kill buffers).
Or just leave it as it is and let the yanker sort it out?
