CHANGES
   Files added.

Makefile:
   Change the PROGRAM build from em to uemacs

epath.h:
    Fix a left-over from build testing - change the startup file name
    from  nuemacs.rc to uemacs.rc

word.c
    Change justpara() so that it can handle unicode characters, based on
    the fillpara() code from merging.
    Get the correct indent from column, not byte offset.
    Handle leading whitespace in the paragraph to reformat.
    Make the temporary buffer dynamically allocated, to cater for long
    strings with no spaces.
    Add punctuation handling in ggr-mode.

etc/uemacs.rc
    Bind EscR to search-reverse (not the default replace-string).

etc/uemacs.hlp
    Put back that Metas that had been changed to Esc.

complet.c
    Replace strncpy() calls to populate choices with memcpy(), as we
    have to nul-terminate manually anyway.

eval.c
exec.c
input.c
    Replace strncpy() calls followed by "manual" nul-termination with
    memcpy() ones.

lock.c
    Replace strncpy() call into tmpname with just strcpy(), as fname
    can't be more the NFILEN anyway.

README
readme.39e
     Moved both to the archive directory.

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.101
