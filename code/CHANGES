See GGR4.100.changes for the original changes around moving from 3.9e to
pK4.105.

========== GGR4.101 [21 Feb 2017]
.gitignore
CHANGES
   Files added.

Makefile:
   Change the PROGRAM build from em to uemacs

epath.h:
    Fix a left-over from build testing - change the startup file name
    from  nuemacs.rc to uemacs.rc

word.c
    Change justpara() so that it can handle unicode characters, based on
    the fillpara() code from merging.
    Get the correct indent from column, not byte offset.
    Handle leading whitespace in the paragraph to reformat.
    Make the temporary buffer dynamically allocated, to cater for long
    strings with no spaces.
    Add punctuation handling in ggr-mode.

etc/uemacs.rc
    Bind EscR to search-reverse (not the default replace-string).

etc/uemacs.hlp
    Put back that Metas that had been changed to Esc.

complet.c
    Replace strncpy() calls to populate choices with memcpy(), as we
    have to nul-terminate manually anyway.

eval.c
exec.c
input.c
    Replace strncpy() calls followed by "manual" nul-termination with
    memcpy() ones.

lock.c
    Replace strncpy() call into tmpname with just strcpy(), as fname
    can't be more the NFILEN anyway.

README
readme.39e
     Moved both to the archive directory.

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.101

========== GGR4.102 [22 Feb 2017]

word.c
    Right-justification in fillpara() was leaving an extra space at eol
    after a punctuation mark.
    Increment gap as well if dotflag is set.

word.c
    justify-paragraph (Esc-J) changes had stopped it working at the
    start of a buffer and if there was no whitespace at the start of the
    paragraph. 
    Ignore whitedelete() result and force w_doto to 0 (since at the
    start of the buffer it seems to end up as 1). 

buffer,c
    Just entering <CR> when prompted for "Use buffer:" (^XB) used to
    take you back to the last one, but now takes you to "main". 
    Add back a save of b_name to savnam in swbuffer() missed in the
    migration.

tcap.c
display.c
    Add test for SCROLLCODE around some declarations to avoid
    compilation warnings if this is turned off. 

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.102

========== GGR4.103
