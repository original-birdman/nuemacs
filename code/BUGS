Might not be a bug - juts needs a think...
Word-wrapping doesn't happen on yank(), even if there is a space in the
yank()ed text.
But then there is also the question of what happens to newlines in
the restored text.
Also, when wrapping, shoud we just wrap the last word, or wrap the line
a first-before fillcol?
Perhaps do wrapping if wrap-mode was on at *both* the kill and yank
stages (so need to have a way of tagging the kill buffers).

"I see .rc file has to be specified by an absolute path."
Change the search code. It shouldn't include CWD by default. Not sure
about relative paths - probably not in general (security issues - they
depend on where you are).
Try to get the search path defined in the Makefile(?).
It might also be possible to set it in uemacs.rc,but that leaves you in
a chicken-and-egg situation.
