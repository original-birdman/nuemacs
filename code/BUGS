Might not be a bug - just needs a think...
Word-wrapping doesn't happen on yank(), even if there is a space in the
yank()ed text.
But then there is also the question of what happens to newlines in
the restored text.
Also, when wrapping, should we just wrap the last word, or wrap the line
at first-before fillcol?
Perhaps do wrapping if wrap-mode was on at *both* the kill and yank
stages (so need to have a way of tagging the kill buffers).

"I see .rc file has to be specified by an absolute path."
Change the search code. It shouldn't include CWD by default. Not sure
about relative paths - probably not in general (security issues - they
depend on where you are).
Try to get the search path defined in the Makefile(?).
It might also be possible to set it in uemacs.rc,but that leaves you in
a chicken-and-egg situation.

uemacs isn't handling combining diacritical marks correctly. It assumes
they occupy a column, but in fact they are "zero-width", as they combine
with the preceding character.
The Unicode ranges for these are:
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character)

 Combining Diacritical Marks (0300–036F), since version 1.0, with
 Combining Diacritical Marks Extended (1AB0–1AFF), version 7.0
 Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement (1DC0–1DFF), versions 4.1 to 5.2
 Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols (20D0–20FF), v1 -> v5.1
 Combining Half Marks (FE20–FE2F), versions 1.0, mode up to v8

test-files/combining-diacritics shows the issue.

Horizontal scrolling (which was in 3.9e).
Did anyone ever use it?
