Word-wrapping causes the beginning of the wrapped line to be lost on
screen on a <CR> - a <SP> is OK.
It does exist, and can be seen on a refresh.

4.1 result - which actually does *not* depend on wrap mode.
On a long line (when the line has been shifted left to display the R/h
side) a CR result in the line being redrawn starting at col7 (missing 7
chars). It is always 7, regardless of how long the line is.

It also doesn't depend on CR. Just go to the end of a long line, get the
$ up in col 1 then step backwards - you will lose 7 chars once the $
goes.

Word-wrapping doesn't happen on yank(), even if there is a space in the
yank()ed text.
But then there is also the question of what happens to newlines in
the restored text.
Also, when wrapping, shoud we just wrap the last word, or wrap the line
a first-before fillcol?
