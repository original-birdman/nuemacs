See GGR4.100.changes for the original changes around moving from 3.9e to
pK4.0.15.

========== GGR4.101 [21 Feb 2017]

.gitignore
CHANGES
   Files added.

Makefile:
   Change the PROGRAM build from em to uemacs

epath.h:
    Fix a left-over from build testing - change the startup file name
    from  nuemacs.rc to uemacs.rc

word.c
    Change justpara() so that it can handle unicode characters, based on
    the fillpara() code from merging.
    Get the correct indent from column, not byte offset.
    Handle leading whitespace in the paragraph to reformat.
    Make the temporary buffer dynamically allocated, to cater for long
    strings with no spaces.
    Add punctuation handling in ggr-mode.

etc/uemacs.rc
    Bind EscR to search-reverse (not the default replace-string).

etc/uemacs.hlp
    Put back that Metas that had been changed to Esc.

complet.c
    Replace strncpy() calls to populate choices with memcpy(), as we
    have to nul-terminate manually anyway.

eval.c
exec.c
input.c
    Replace strncpy() calls followed by "manual" nul-termination with
    memcpy() ones.

lock.c
    Replace strncpy() call into tmpname with just strcpy(), as fname
    can't be more the NFILEN anyway.

README
readme.39e
    Moved both to the archive directory.

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.101

========== GGR4.102 [22 Feb 2017]

word.c
    Right-justification in fillpara() was leaving an extra space at eol
    after a punctuation mark.
    Increment gap as well if dotflag is set.

word.c
    justify-paragraph (Esc-J) changes had stopped it working at the
    start of a buffer and if there was no whitespace at the start of the
    paragraph.
    Ignore whitedelete() result and force w_doto to 0 (since at the
    start of the buffer it seems to end up as 1).

buffer,c
    Just entering <CR> when prompted for "Use buffer:" (^XB) used to
    take you back to the last one, but now takes you to "main".
    Add back a save of b_name to savnam in swbuffer() missed in the
    migration.

tcap.c
display.c
    Add test for SCROLLCODE around some declarations to avoid
    compilation warnings if this is turned off.

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.102

========== GGR4.103 [22 Feb 2017]

display.c
    Fix a display issue on de-extending a line (coming back to <~col 80
    after having gone beyond there on a long line).
    Looks like a code migration issue.  The loop in upddex() contained
    the 3.9e code, but with the now-absent w_fcol changed to w_fcolor,
    which was set to 7 resulting in an off-by-7 on the redisplay (the
    underlying data was OK, so a redisplay fixed things).
    Replaced with the 4.1 code (but kept the GGR fix on the loop
    constraint).

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.103

========== GGR4.104 [22 Feb 2017]

input.c
    Ensure that getstring doesn't return a garbage buffer, regardless of
    returned status.
    But beware that some callers use the output buffer as a temporary
    prompt buffer!

edef.h
efunc.h
globals.c
names.c
word.c
etc/uemacs.rc
    Add eos_chars() function, eos_list global list and eos-chars
    macro-callable function to set eos_list.
    Use the eos_list in both justpara() and fillpara() for end of
    sentence character handling (an additional space) and remove any
    such added space from the final sentence of a paragraph.
    Define the standard GGR setting ( .!? ) in uemacs.rc.

.gitignore
    Added core

archive/example.rc
    Added.

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.104

========== GGR4.105 [25 Feb2017]

docs/utf8.info
test-files/combining-diacritics
    Added

Makefile
    Replace "-D_BSD_SOURCE -D_SVID_SOURCE" with "-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE" in
    DEFINES for Linux. Some distros warn about this.

basic.c
    Use next_utf8_offset()/prev_utf8_offset() to find start of utf8
    characters.

display.c
    In updpos() we need to allow for the same number of characters
    used by vtputc() for *all* non-printing characters.

globals.c
names.c
random.c
word.c
edef.h
efunc.h
etc/uemacs.rc
    Rename *ggr.mode to *ggr.style, as it isn't a mode.

random.c
    Tidy up the current position display code in showcpos().

utf8.c
utf8.h
    Use MAX_UTF8_LEN for max length of a utf8 sequence. Which, since
    2003, is 4 (not 6).
    Add next_utf8_offset() and prev_utf8_offset() functions.
    Removed is_beginning_utf8().

word.c
    Change prompt in eos_chars() and display current setting.

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.105

========== GGR4.106 [26 Feb 2017]

Makefile
    Add back "-D_BSD_SOURCE -D_SVID_SOURCE" while keeping
    "-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE" in DEFINES for Linux.
    Both need to be there for a transitional period.
    Also added "-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE" to the non-Linux branches as the
    uemacs code itself doesn't use any of them so is just setting them
    for system header files, which can use them or not as they see fit.

archive/original-git.log
    The log of changes from the original pK4.0.15 git repository.

etc/uemacs.rc
    Add a description of some environment variable settings and set
    $overlap to 2 (which was the value used by 3.9e).

fileio.c
file.c
    Check for strcpy()ing a name to itself, which happens when
    activating an inactive buffer.
    The action of strcpy() is undefined for overlapping strings.
    On a Mac it will crash...

display.c
    Change the unexplained 4 in several malloc()s to be sizeof(unicode_t).

basic.c
    Correct the fix in forwpage() to stop before we loop round, and
    hence stay on the last line, not go one past it.
    (Incorrectly merged from 3.9e.)

input.c
    Remove a redundant set of braces around (c == (CONTROL|'I')) as
    otherwise the Mac compiler warns about a possible intended
    assignment.

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.106

========== GGR4.107...

README
CHANGES
KNOWN_ISSUES
    Added README, moved CHANGES and BUGS (=> KNOWN_ISSUES) up to main
    directory.

random.c
    In cinsert(), skip over trailing blank space when looking for a
    trailing '{' and keep correct indent count (not one less for blank
    lines).

charset.h
efunc.h
estruct.h
    Add #ifndef lines to allow for multiple inclusion.

bind.c
input.c
efunc.h
    Change ostring() calls to mlputs and some tidying.
    Remove unused outstring and (now) unused ostring code and
    declarations.

input.c
    getname() code re-indented to make it readable.
    Changed a while() loop to for().
    Increment ttcol during TTputc calls in the expansion code.

word.c
    Ensure that text comes back in the original order after multiple
    successive delete-previous-word calls.

main.c
    Extended usage() to list all available options.
    Added -h (for --help) and -V (for --version) options.
    Allow options to be given as separate tokens.
    Add -d option for specifying config/help directories.

bind.c
eval.c
exec.c
globals.c
main.c
spawn.c
edef.h
efunc.h
epath.h
    Redo code that looks for start-up/help files etc.
    Add INTABLE and INPATH modes to flook(). Fix calls in bind.c,
    eval.c, exec.c, spawn.c
    to use the appropriate setting.
    Only look in current directory in flook() is the insecure (-i)
    command line option has been given.
    Add set_pathname() to bind.c to allow the command-line processing to
    alter the directory path to one given location.
    Add -i (insecure) command line option and associated global flag.
    Alter the structure set-ups in epath.h.  You can now set the default
    table values by defining DFLT_PATH in the compilation options.  The
    help and start-up file names are now uemacs.hlp and uemacs.rc in all
    cases.

version.h
etc/uemacs.hlp
    Update to version GGR4.107
