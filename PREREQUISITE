========== JuliaLang utf8proc ==========
Version GGR4.115 improved unicode character handling (such as upper and
lower-casing) by using the Julia Lang utf8proc library for character
properties.  As a result this library is now a pre-requisite for this
version of uemacs.

The library is available from https://julialang.org/utf8proc/
(downloadable from https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc).

To use it you can either place it alongside the nuemacs repository (or
the code sub-directory) and build it (in which case uemacs will use the
static library from there) or install it to you system, in which case
uemacs will use the dynamic library.  Read the Makefile for more
details.

========== libbacktrace ==========

Version GGR4.133 added a crude stack trace dump optional capability
which required the external addr2line program, but this was changed at
GGR4.133 to use libbacktrace, so that it was self-contained.
This functionality only works (in that it only produces anything useful)
on x86_64 architectures.

The library is available at
    https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace

Download the zip file, unpack, run ./configure and make.
You may then either:

 o Install this to the system (by default /usr/local/lib).  The build
   will use the dynamic libraries.

 o Put the libbacktrace-master directory alongside the nuemacs
   repository (or the code sub-directory) and the build will use the
   static library.

 o Copy just the libbacktrace.a (under .libs) backtrace.h and
   backtrace-supported.h into a libbacktrace directory and put that
   alongside the nuemacs repository or code sub-directory.
