Version GGR4.115 improved unicode character handling (such as upper and
lower-casing) by using the Julia Lang utf8proc library for character
properties.  As a result this library is now a pre-requisite for this
version of uemacs.

The library is available from https://julialang.org/utf8proc/
(downloadable from https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc).

To use it you can either place it alongside the nuemacs repository code
and build it (in which case uemacs will use the static library from
there) or install it to you system, in which case uemacs will use the
dynamic library.  Read the Makefile for more details.
