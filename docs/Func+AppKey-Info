Keyboard mapping results I found with the GGR4.163 CSI mapping code.

gnome-terminal is the same as XFree4/macOS.
The (real) Linux terminal is the same as the KDE Linux Console, except
    NumkeyPad5 sends FNG.
xterm+"Sun function keys" does not work.

* if "Delete is DEL" is not set in xterm.

Since the standard uemacs.rc now maps "both" sets of keys (FNH and FN1,
FNP and FNa, etc.) keys should have the same effect everywhere (excepy
using VT220 keys on xterm - so don't).
