Make word-split chars configurable (forwword, backword but *not*
fillpara).  i.e.  make inword() list configurable (as the comment there
says it should be).  Or make it use lgetgrapheme, and treat as a
word-char anything whose base is a word-char.  Or both...

==========

Get all code that gets values (especially setvar, but also command-line
and user-input) to allow NUL as a valid char. So can't use strcpy etc.
Can these things all become dyn_str?
