Make word-split chars configurable (forwword, backword but *not*
fillpara).  i.e.  make inword() list configurable (as the comment there
says it should be).  Or make it use lgetgrapheme, and treat as a
word-char anything whose base is a word-char.  Or both...

========== Search Issues!!! ==========

Normal search

  1. Must check what follows an apparent match - can't be a combining
     diacritical mark (but a zero-width joiner is OK!).
     NOTE: that for reverse searching this means looking at what
     precedes the test (in a way...).

  2. Has to be able to handle case-insensitive Unicode matches.


Magic search

  1. Has to be able to handle Unicode char range (bitmaps).

  2. Has to be able to handle case-insensitive Unicode matches.

  3. Possibly allow a range for a base char with a constant set of
     extended parts?


General Notes:

DIFCASE and CHCASE need to go (estruct.h and search.c).
Also all of:

 LASTUL LASTLL isupper  isxletter isxlower isxupper  [estruct.h only]
 isletter                       [estruct.h, search.c, word.c]
 islower                        [estruct.h, search.c, input.c]
