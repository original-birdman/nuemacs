Make word-split chars configurable (forwword, backword but *not*
fillpara).  i.e.  make inword() list configurable (as the comment there
says it should be).  Or make it use lgetglyph, and treat as a word-char
anything whose base is a word-char.  Or both...

Handle zero-width word separator in forwword and justpara (etc.). 
Related to lgetglyph bit above.
